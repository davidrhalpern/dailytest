    <p>Today is July 29th 2023, I have decided to be more proactive about things and not do things that do not provide personnel growth.</p>
    <p>I am not saying having fun is not important, but I want the fun to also provide growth as well.</p><p>Some things don't give the personnel growth</p>
    <p>I also want to look into Martin shorts 9 baskets

        Alot of extroplation in here on the first day!
