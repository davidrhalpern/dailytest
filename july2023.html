   <h2>July 29th</h2>
   <p>July 29th, what a day,  started off with no garage sales, we need to minimize and reduce in the house.
    Gabe went to a real fun birthday party at encourage! Parents did a great job, only 2 hours long but packed
    with fun.  They even made delicious food for the parents.  An A+ Birthday party.  Came back home ran to
    auction house to pick up drum stool from auction win.  Then a huge storm came through town, knocking down trees
    on george washington parkway.  picked up Brandon for the My morning jacket concert, had a bit of confusion
    with Paul but finally met up with him in old town, he drove us to kabob palace a pretty good meal
    then off to the DC Wharf for the concert.  The concert was amazing, they literally played all my
    favorite songs and they gave DC more than worth thier money, easily over 2 hours of live amazing
    music.  I can now understand why people say My Morning Jacket is one of the best live bands.
    They really are one of the few bands that have extended jams but go hard.  The drummer looked like a Mountain
    and really encouraged me to get back into drumming!

   <p> The nice thing about going out it like refuels you if you haven't been out for a long time
    makes you realize people are doing things out there.  Of course looking around I saw alot of old folks
    but then realized...oh yeah. I am old. got back home around 1 am.  A good day!
   </p>
